# Transformer Emotion Analysis

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of a Transformer architecture for emotion analysis. The Transformer model is fine-tuned on an emotion dataset, and the hidden states are extracted for downstream tasks such as logistic regression and evaluation using a dummy classifier.
## in this repo you find example of real world NLP task using advance algo like Transformers,RNN,CNN,LSTM
## also inlcude the rag and fine tunning approch for QA.
